        <p>Flies, known for their shortsightedness, serve as the core of our website's narrative. Despite the perspective being that of a fly, the soundscape immerses users in the environment from a human perspective. Small yet significant, the Favicon symbolizes the fly's presence. The central concept revolves around the gradual clarity of imagery and amplification of sound as users scroll. Progression occurs as the fly reacts to the enticing aroma of fried food, ultimately being driven away by its allure.</p>
        <p>For the images accompanying the audio in the website, we decided to take our own pictures of D2. We thought it would be especially effective to have the photos correspond with the audio—for example, the second image, a picture of fried food from the grill, is accompanied by an audio clip focusing on sounds from the grill. As users engage with the website from the perspective of a fly, we also thought that it would make sense for us to try and emulate what the world might look like through a fly’s compound eyes. We achieved this effect by editing the images using Adobe Photoshop—most critical to this process was making a pattern of repeating hexagons and overlaying it as a filter on top of the images. Using the edited images, we decided to add one more touch of interactivity by making the image become less blurry as the user scrolls down the page. This adds an air of curiosity by allowing for the user to spend more time listening to the audio and guessing what the image (and the origin of the audio) might be. </p>
        <p> Every sound is triggered by clicking the sound button on the top left corner. If it’s not triggered, the icon shows a cross next to the button. The main modification we did to the sound is layering. We recorded the D2 ambience for this section. We cut multiple takes, piecing together the ones that have the sound of people moving the chair, talking, and cutleries touching, with a fade-in fade out & denoise effect.</p>
